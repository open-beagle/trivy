# Podman

[EXPERIMENTAL] This feature might change without preserving backwards compatibility.

Scan your image in Podman (>=2.0) running locally. The remote Podman is not supported.
Before performing Trivy commands, you must enable the podman.sock systemd service on your machine.
For more details, see [here][sock]

```bash
$ systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket
```

Then, you can scan your image in Podman.

```bash
$ cat Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.12
RUN apk add --no-cache bash
$ podman build -t test .
$ podman images
REPOSITORY                TAG     IMAGE ID      CREATED      SIZE

$ trivy image test
```
